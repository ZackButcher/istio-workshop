## Exercise 8 - Request Routing and Canary Deployments

Because there are 2 version of the HelloWorld Service Deployment (v1 and v2), before modifying any of the routes a default route needs to be set to just V1.  Otherwise it will just round robin between V1 and V2

#### Configure the default route for hello world service

1 - Set the default version for all requests to the hello world service using :

```
istioctl create -f guestbook/route-rule-force-hello-v1.yaml
```

This ingress rule forces v1 of the service by giving it a weight of 100.

2 - Now when you curl the echo service it should always return V1 of the hello world service:

```
$ curl 35.188.171.180/echo/universe  

{"greeting":{"hostname":"helloworld-service-v1-286408581-9204h","greeting":"Hello universe from helloworld-service-v1-286408581-9204h with 1.0","version":"1.0"},"

$ curl 35.188.171.180/echo/universe

{"greeting":{"hostname":"helloworld-service-v1-286408581-9204h","greeting":"Hello universe from helloworld-service-v1-286408581-9204h with 1.0","version":"1.0"},"

```

#### Canary Deployments

Currently the routing rule routes only to V1 of the hello world service which is not real useful. What we want to do next is a canary deployment and push some of the traffic to V2. This can be done by creating another rule with a higher precedence that routes some of the traffic to V2 based on http headers.  As an example we will use the following canary deployment in canary-helloworld.yaml  This rule routes all traffic from a mobile user agent to version 2.0 of the service.

```
    destination:
      name: helloworld-service
    match:
      request:
        headers:
          user-agent:
            exact: mobile
    precedence: 2
    route:
      - labels:
          version: "2.0"
```

Note that rules with a higher precedence number are applied first.  If a precedence is not specified then it defaults to 0.  So with these 2 rules in place the one with precedence 2 will be applied first.

Test this out by creating the rule:

```
    istioctl create -f guestbook/canary-helloworld.yaml
```

Now when you curl the end point set the user agent to be mobile and you should only see V2:

```
$ curl http://104.198.198.111/echo/universe -A mobile

{"greeting":{"hostname":"helloworld-service-v2-3297856697-6m4bp","greeting":"Hello dog2 from helloworld-service-v2-3297856697-6m4bp with 2.0","version":"2.0"}

$ curl 35.188.171.180/echo/universe

{"greeting":{"hostname":"helloworld-service-v1-286408581-9204h","greeting":"Hello universe from helloworld-service-v1-286408581-9204h with 1.0","version":"1.0"},"

```

An important point to note is that the user-agent http header is propagated in the span baggage.  Look at these two classes for details:

#### Optional - Route based on the browser

It is also possible to route it based on the Web Browser.  For example the following routes to version 2.0 if the browser is chrome:

```
  match:
    request:
      headers:
        user-agent:
          regex: ".*Chrome.*"
  route:
  - labels:
      version: "2.0"
```

To apply this route run:

```
    istioctl create -f route-ui-user-agent-chrome.yaml
```

Then navigate to the home page in chrome and another browser.
